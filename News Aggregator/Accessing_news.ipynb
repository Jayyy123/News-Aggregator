      "SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter shook up the top ranks of its security team this week with the termination of the head of security and the exit of the chief information security officer, the company told employees on Wednesday, as its new chief executive reorganizes the social media service.\n",
      "Peiter Zatko, the head of security, who is better known within the security community as Mudge, is no longer at the company, Twitter confirmed.\n",
      "Rinki Sethi, the chief information security officer, will depart in the coming weeks.\n",
      "The changes followed “an assessment of how the organization was being led and the impact on top priority work,” according to a memo from Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, that was sent to employees on Wednesday and obtained by The New York Times.\n",
      "Mr. Agrawal said the “nature of this situation” limited what he was allowed to share with employees.\n"
